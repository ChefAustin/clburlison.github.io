[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/clburlison/clburlison.github.io.svg?branch=source)](https://travis-ci.org/clburlison/clburlison.github.io) - This travis job builds this website on each `git push`. Allowing me to use `jekyll` without the `--safe` option that [Github pages](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/plugins/) forces.
