New with 10.12.4, Apple has decided to protect the locationd LaunchDaemon with System Integrity Protection (SIP).

If you are not aware the locationd daemon is used for Location Services. This is the process that drives: FindMyMac, "Set time zone automatically using current location", it allows applications to locate your computer, and more.

Some points to take away from this change:

1. this modification happened during a point release
1. this path is not in `/System/Library/Sandbox/rootless.conf`
1. this restricts the ability to load and unload the daemon in any automated fashion
1. this breaks many of the bash scripts floating around that are used to enable the auto time zone feature

You can verify this change with the following command:

```bash
ls -laO /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.locationd.plist
```

Notice `restricted` in the output:

```bash
-rw-r--r--  1 root  wheel  restricted,compressed 573 Aug 29  2016 /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.locationd.plist
```

This means you are no longer able to unload the daemon with:

```bash
sudo launchctl unload /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.locationd.plist
```

If you try you will receive the following error:

```bash
/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.locationd.plist: Operation not permitted while System Integrity Protection is engaged
```

You can verify that the service is indeed running with:

```bash
sudo launchctl list | grep locationd
```

Seeing as how you might want to make changes to location services you work around this restriction with a `killall -9 locationd`. At least for now...


Hat tap to Michael Pinto (@pintom) and Balmes Pavlov (@bp) for the ping that lead to this discovery in the MacAdmins Slack.
