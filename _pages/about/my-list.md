This page is kind of personal but I have always found that if I write my goals down it is much easier to obtain them. Before I created this page I use to have everything stored in a pages document, and before that I use to keep it in a Facebook note. 

The idea behind this page came from Thomas Frank over at [collegeinfogeek.com](http://collegeinfogeek.com), you can find his list [here](http://collegeinfogeek.com/about/meet-the-author/my-impossible-list/). One change I made from Thomas was the name of my list. He refers to his list as "my impossible list", I on the other hand dislike thinking of any goal as impossible even if it is just by association. So below I would like to introduce you to "my list" aka the goals I would like to achieve. Note: if you check out the original impossible list by [Joel Runyol](http://impossiblehq.com/impossible-list) you will see his reasoning for the name...I simply disagree.


If by chance you have some motivation and wish to create your own list feel free to post a link on Twitter. I'd love to read what goals you have set.

## Current focus:

1. Graduate from college w/ Bachelors Degree
1. Learn Swift


The idea behind having a a current focus section is to disregard everything else on this page. It is easy to become stretched too thin. It is easy to want to do everything. It is hard to accomplish everything when all you can think about it everything else. I try to limit this area to five or less.
