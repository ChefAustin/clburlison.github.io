This blog is setup as a personal resource for myself. Eventually, I will grow the information on this blog so that others can gain some educational value.  

The site originally was hosted on Amazon's S3 backend with the content being created through [Octopress](http://octopress.org/). Currently, I am hosting this site on [Github](https://github.com) while the web pages are generated using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).
