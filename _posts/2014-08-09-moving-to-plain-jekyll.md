Finally moved the blog over from Octopress to a plain Jekyll setup. This allows me to have a bit more control while also removing some of the fluff that was installed by Ocotopress but I did not use. I am very glad to have found such a great theme created by Michael Rose. I will release another post once I have had a little more time to play around. As of this momemnt it is about 10 times faster to generate the website on my laptop. The ``--watch`` flag from jekyll is also faster.
