My name is Clayton Burlison and I am a Macintosh administrator based in Texas, with an interest in Open Source products.  

I have been managing Macintosh computers since 2009, and now I am lucky enough to be managing Macs full time. Articles on this site will include information related to [osx](/blog/categories/osx/), [munki](/blog/categories/munki/), [reposado](/blog/categories/reposado/), [automation](/blog/categories/automation/), and [more](/blog/categories/). The Macintosh community is an amazing resource for users both new and old alike. Hopefully you can find something helpful on this blog...my attempt at giving a little back to the community.  

Many articles on this site will have external references. If you feel I have material on this site and did not give credit where due please contact me by email and I will get this fixed.  

Please feel free to link to anything I have written here and all of the code can be considered open source unless otherwise stated. (credit is appreciated though not required)

###Personal Life
Besides work, I am currently a part time student attending the University of Arlington, major is Information Systems. In my free time I like to play Dota 2. And if you could not guess it from the site favicon I really enjoy running. 

###Site Comments
Feel free to use comments as a way for feedback, corrections, further discussion, etc. It is silly to put this in writing but be respectful and that should cover all the bases. I reserve the final say on all comments.
