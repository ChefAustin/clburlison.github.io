My name is Clayton Burlison and I am a Macintosh administrator based in Texas, with an interest in Open Source products.  

I have been managing Macintosh computers since 2009, and now I am lucky enough to be managing Macs full time. Articles on this site will include information related to [osx](/categories/osx/), [munki](/categories/munki/), [reposado](/categories/reposado/), [automation](/categories/automation/), and [more](/categories/). The Macintosh community is an amazing resource for users both new and old alike. Hopefully you can find something helpful on this blog...my attempt at giving a little back to the community.  

Many articles on this site will have external references. If you feel I have material on this site and did not give credit where due please contact me by email and I will get this fixed.  

Please feel free to link to anything I have written here and all of the code can be considered open source unless otherwise stated. (credit is appreciated though not required)  

Site info can be found [here](/about/site-info/).

###Personal Life
Besides work, I am currently a part time student attending the University of Arlington, major is Information Systems. In my free time I enjoy playing video games and if you could not guess it from the site favicon I really enjoy running/being active. 

###My list
This is a simple list I use to keep up with my goals. I host it on this site to share and hopefully give others motivation to reach for their goals. It also helps keep me held responsible since everyone in the world can see. To see my current list click [here](/about/my-list/).

###Site Comments
Feel free to use comments as a way for feedback, corrections, further discussion, etc. It is silly to put this in writing but be respectful and that should cover all the bases. I reserve the final say on all comments.
